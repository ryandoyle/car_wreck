Please read the following before starting the test
==================================================

SCENARIO

    Superupload provides a basic file upload web application, similar to 
    megaupload/rapidshare. Moments ago a brown-out caused the main application
    server to reboot.

    Superupload have not followed good operational practices and aren't using 
    configration management! Their website did not come back up after the
    server reboot and the CEO is very grumpy.

YOUR MISSION

    You need to get the web application back up ASAP! There are some notes 
    about how the server is setup scribbled on the back of a serviette:

    * The web application is written in PHP and runs on Apache
    * The OS is RedHat Enterprise Linux
    * Files are in default locations

THE TEST
    * You have an hour to get the site back up and running
    * Best-practices will be awarded higher than quick hacks
    * Use whatever resources are required as long as the test is done by 
      yourself
